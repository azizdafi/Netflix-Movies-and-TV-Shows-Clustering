This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

innitially we start with understanding the data set, then we clean the data to make analysis ready.

explore the data and understand the behaviour of the same.

we then prepare the data for creating clusters by various parameters wherein we remove stop words, white spaces numbers etc so that we can get important words and based on that we shall form clusters.

later I have used the silhoute method and kmeans elbow method to find optimal number of clusters and built recommender system by cosine similarity and recommended top 5 movies.
